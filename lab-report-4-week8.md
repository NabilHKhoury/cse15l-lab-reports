# Lab Report 4
In this lab report, I am using my `MarkdownParseTest.java` and another persons file to test three Snippets of code. Due to my grandmother passing away, I did not attend Lab 7. Therefore, I did not do the work on someone else, so I decided to do this on `nidhidhamnani` or the repository that I originally forked. To be clear, I did it on the updated version of the file that we cloned in Lab 8. 
## Snippet 1
I put the first Snippet of tests in a file called Snippet1.md. Here is what it looks like. \

The test I created is the following.

In my `MarkdownParseTest.java` file, the result was the following. \

In the other file, the result was the following .\

If there was a problem this is how to fix it.
